## Objective Gentoo


The Objective Gentoo project aims to provide short definite paths for installing Gentoo Linux within specific boundaries and requirements.

---

Currently, the only source document is `gentoo_install_guide.rst`

Also included is a `gentoo_install_guide.man`. It is generated using `rst2man`, which is part of `docutils`. It can be read from the terminal using

`man -l gentoo_install_guide.man`

---


The project has been started with one path - a basic desktop Gentoo non-systemd install.

The document is written in reStructuredText primarily because of its support for outlining. Traditional heading style documents don't function well for this type of writing. The level of document headers is limited to two or three.

If the project grows, I would envision the document becomming dynamic so the user can select the constraints they want, and get in return a firm set of instructions for that path.
