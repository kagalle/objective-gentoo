Objective Gentoo

The Objective Gentoo project aims to provide short definite paths for installing Gentoo Linux within specific boundaries and requirements.

The project starts out with one path - a basic desktop Gentoo non-systemd install. Document written in reStructuredText primarily because of its support for outlining. Traditional heading style documents don't function well for this type of writing. Limiting the level of document headers to two or three.

If the project grows, I would envision the document becomming dynamic so the user can select the constraints they want, and get in return a firm set of instructions for that path.
